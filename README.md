# Files transfer
file transferring app / web-app project using Flutter + Spring Boot
## Why ?
Honestly, I just want to make my life easier (really ?) when sending or receiving files between my devices.
## Idea + Issue
1. My code works as intended, but it requires some modifications to run on every platform. Currently, it functions as a desktop web-app (mobile web-app can't download file TT) and a Windows application
2. I'm too lazy to clean up my code because I've left some debugging snippets in there.
3. I probably hate front-end, but coding with Flutter is surprisingly fun!"

## Spring Boot
I just wanted to experiment with an older tech stack, but it turned out to be much better than I expectedâ€”rich libraries and great readability!
Okay, I gotta be honest, I didn't do good on the security . File locking is about all I got covered for downloads and deletes.

## Disclaimer
I found a WebRTC file transfer app on GitHub and the Play Store. Seeing it published 
there gives me some ideas on how I might improve the performance and security of my own project
